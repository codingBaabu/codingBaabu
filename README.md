## :earth_americas: ABOUT ME :earth_americas:
I am **Ravin Panday**, a Guyanese **Web Developer** (specializing in front-end web-technologies) who recently completed a Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science**.

I enjoy challenging myself with diverse projects, especially games! From the very first turn-based RPG I made in **Pascal**, to the space shooter I made in **Java**, and the 2D survival game I made in **Javascript**, to name a few. 

In 2023, I focused on strengthening my fundamental skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** before getting familiar with quite a few modern technologies. These include **React**, **React Router**, **Typescript**, **SASS**, **Jasmine**, **Webpack**, **Vite**, **Node.js**, and **Express.js**. 

During this time, I was consistently exposed to **RESTful APIs**, having both used and built them. My process throughout my learning journey was, "Learn some tech, then build something with it." You can peek at some of what I built right here on **Github**!

Outside of coding, I enjoy anything that lets me be creative. I cook, engage in graphic design, organize events, and I love to write. Most recently, I completed a collection of short stories called **Trials in Humanity**.

If you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat, feel free to reach out!
